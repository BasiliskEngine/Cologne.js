# Cologne.js
Make your JavaScript smell great.

# Purpose
The literal purpose of Cologne.js is to make your JavaScript attractive.
	In order to keep your JavaScript cool and from smelling bad, use deodorant.js. But,
	that's underwhelming if you are trying to impress. Therefore, use Cologne.js to make
	your JavaScript not just not smell bad, but make it smell great. Cologne.js actually just
	teaches you how to write good JavaScript, pretty much by guiding you through how Cologne.js
	itself would implement some really simple things. Mostly just repetitive MVC and class stuff.
	Don't worry, spray some Cologne.js and your JavaScript will smell great.
